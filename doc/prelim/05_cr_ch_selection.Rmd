## Model Exploration

Consider the various possible creatinine change episodes with a time interval width of 1hr.
Investigate only T<sub>AKI</sub> in 8-16hrs after cr<sub>ch</sub>

A heuristic is defined as
$$
\text{heuristic} = \frac{1}{2.1}\left(\text{AUC}\times1.1 + \frac{n(\text{Included Admissions})}{n(\text{All Admissions})}\right)
$$
in order to help with model selection. This heuristic is normalised between $[0,1]$ and provides a slightly heavier weighting to $\text{AUC}$.

```{r generator_function, echo=FALSE}
```

```{r Example_1hr_incr_spread, echo=FALSE, fig.height=6.5, fig.width=11}
```
